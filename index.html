                Motivation is great when it shows up — it gives you energy, excitement, and momentum.
                But let’s be honest: motivation is inconsistent. Some days you wake up ready to conquer the world, and some days you can
                barely get out of bed.
                
                This is why discipline matters.
                Discipline is doing what needs to be done, even when you don’t feel like it.
                
                Below is a realistic guide to developing discipline when your motivation disappears.

                <h2>Accept That Motivation Is Temporary</h2>
                <p>Motivation is unpredictable. It comes and goes depending on your mood, environment, or situation.
                If you rely on motivation alone, you will succeed only on your good days.
                
                Discipline begins with accepting that you won’t always feel like doing the work — and that’s okay.
                Action matters more than emotion.</p>

                        <p>When a task feels huge, your brain will try to avoid it.
                        The trick is to shrink your starting point.</p>
